10. What does `Object.seal()` do and when would you use it?

<hr/>

11. What does `Object.freeze()` do and when would you use it?

<hr/>

13. What legal JS values can be put into a typed array created with `new Uint8Array(1024)`?

<hr/>

**For questions 14 - 17, use this object:**

```js
let obj = {
     x: 5,
  y: 10,
     move: function() {
         	this.x++;
            this.y++;
     }
}
```

14. What will be the output of this code?

```js
console.log(obj.speed);
```

<hr/>

15. What will be the output of this code?

```js
obj.speed = 10;
console.log(obj.speed);
```

<hr/>

16. What will be the output of this code?

```js
obj.move();
console.log(obj.x);
```

<hr/>

17. Write JS code that adds a function called `moveBack()` to `obj` that decreases obj's `x` and `y` values by 1

<hr/>

18. Is this legal or will it cause an error?

```js
const x = {name: "Fred"};
x.name = "Mary";
x = {name: "Jane"};
```

<hr/>

19. What is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE – pronounced "iffy") and what is the primary advantage of using one? 

<hr/>

20. Write an example of an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE – pronounced "iffy") below

<hr/>

21. What are some advantages of using the *JavaScript ES5 revealing module pattern*?

<hr/>

22. Convert `obj` in question #14 above to an ES6 class named `Mover`. Give it a constructor that takes `x` and `y` as values. Give it `move()` and `moveBack()` methods

<hr/>

23. Extend the `Mover` class with a class named `RoadRunner`. The `RoadRunner` constructor accepts `x`, `y` and `speed` arguments. Give it a `beepBeep()` method that logs out "Beep Beep!" when called. 

<hr/>

24. Create an object literal named `car` that has the properties `color`, `speed` and `drive`. `color` should be set to red. `speed` should be set to `0`. `drive` should be a function that changes `speed` to `55`.

<hr/>

25. Why did we use a second canvas in the Paint ICE?

<hr/>

26. Write a single line of code that sets the fill style of canvas to green. Assume the canvas drawing context object is in scope and named `ctx`

<hr/>

27. Write a single line of code that sets the stroke style of canvas to red. Assume the canvas drawing context object is in scope and named `ctx`

<hr/>

28. Write code that *fills* a 200 wide, 200 high rectangle at (100,150) path in canvas - do NOT use the the `ctx.fillRect()` convenience method.  Assume the canvas drawing context object is in scope and named `ctx`

<hr/>

29. Write a line of code that *strokes* a circle path in canvas at (100,150) that has a radius of 50. Assume the canvas drawing context object is in scope and named `ctx`

<hr/>

30. Write a line of code that rotates the canvas context by 2 radians. Assume the canvas drawing context object is in scope and named `ctx`

<hr/>

31. Describe what `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` do in canvas

<hr/>

32. Given the following code, what color will the rectangle be on canvas?

```js
let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');              	
let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 
ctx.fillStyle="blue";
ctx.save();
ctx.fillStyle="red";	
ctx.save();
ctx.fillStyle="black";
ctx.save();
ctx.fillStyle="yellow";

ctx.restore();
ctx.restore();
ctx.fillRect(20,20,100,100);
```

<hr/>

33. Describe the characteristics of *raster-based* images

<hr/>

34. Describe the characteristics of *vector-based* images

<hr/>

35. Is canvas *raster* or *vector* based?

<hr/>

36. Explain `Object.create()` and *prototypical inheritance*

<hr/>

37. Explain what `Object.assign()` does

<hr/>

38. Describe the difference between what we see in the Chrome web browser when we "View Page Source" versus when we "Inspect" a page with the *Web Inspector*

<hr/>

39. **Interview-style question:**

Given the following `odds` array, write JS code that will iterate over the `odds` array, add all even numbers to the `evens` array and remove the even numbers from the `odds` array. 
The final version of the `odds` array should only contain odd numbers. The final version of the `evens` array should only contain the even numbers

```js
let  odds  = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
let  evens = [ ];
```

<hr/>

40. **Interview-style question:**

There are five buckets of water. Each bucket can contain 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 ounces of water. The number of ounces in each bucket is tracked sequentially by the buckets array. Write JS code to find which buckets have at least a 2 ounce difference from the bucket before them AND the bucket after them, then print it out. 

The correct values in this example are 2 and 5. The bucket with 2 ounces has a two ounce difference from the previous bucket (4 ounces) and a three ounce difference from the following bucket (5 ounces). The bucket with 5 ounces has a three ounce difference from the previous bucket (2 ounces) and a four ounce difference from the following bucket (1 ounce).

Your code should work regardless of the numbers in this array, but the correct answer is in this example is 2 and 5. 

```js
let  buckets  = [ 3, 4, 2, 5, 1 ];
```
