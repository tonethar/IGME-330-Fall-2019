# Week 6B - ES5/ES6 "Sprites" & Delegation

## Overview
- Sprites (using either Object literals, or ES6 classes) are an optional component of Project 1, and whether you use them or not on your project, understanding how the JavaScript runtime engines represent classes and objects is critical for JS developers to understand.
- We will also review ES6 classes, and how to construct a class hierarchy. We will then spend some time in the debugger to see how the JavaScript runtime represents objects - both those created as literals and those created from classes.


## II. Lecture Notes
- [1 - Intro to Canvas Sprites](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-sprites-1.md)
  - First we try to build a sprite object using script-scoped variables such as `x`, `y`, `radius`, `color`  - BAD!
  - then we group these variables into an object literal - BETTER!
  - lastly we create a factory function to produce multiple object literals - BEST!
  - take a look in the web inspector to see these objects and the default *prototype chains* created via the `__proto__` - i.e. "dunder proto" property - http://2ality.com/2012/10/dunder.html - we will discuss  *prototype* chains in chapter 2 below
  - isn't this inefficient, storing multiple copies of all of these properties and methods?
    - In a class-based environment, each instance of a class would have their own copies of instance variables (like `x` and `y`), but share all of the methods (like `move()`, `reflectX()`, and `reflectY()`)
    - interestingly, all major JavaScript engines already perform this optimization on object literals, and basically generate a "super class/super object" for you. The concept is called *shapes*, and you can read about it here: https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics
    -  No matter how many objects there are, as long as they have the same *shape*, they only have to store the shape and property information once. All JavaScript engines use shapes as an optimization, but they don't all call them shapes:
        - Academic papers call them *Hidden Classes* (confusing w.r.t. JavaScript classes)
        - [V8](https://github.com/v8/v8) calls them *Maps* (confusing w.r.t. JavaScript Maps)
        - [Chakra](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) calls them *Types* (confusing w.r.t. JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic types and typeof)
        - [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore) calls them *Structures*
        - [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey) calls them *Shapes*
        
- [2 - Object.create() & Delegation](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-sprites-2.md)
  - In JavaScript, how can we benefit from the concept of `inheritance` without using classes - answer: the JavaScript *prototype chain*:
    - this is called *prototype-based inheritance*
    - "own" properties and properties 
    - *property shadowing* is basically like "overriding" in class-based languages
  - `Object.create()`
  - Delegation & OLOO - "Objects Linked to Other Objects"
  
- [3 - Canvas & ES6 Classes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-sprites-3.md)
  - JavaScript classes = "syntactical sugar"!
    - but sugar tastes so good!
    - even with classes, behind the scenes, the JS engine is still using the *prototype chain*
    - POLL: do you prefer ES5 delegation, or ES6 classes?
    

## III. Demo/Challenge in Time Remaining

See mycourses for the start files. This example utilizes ES5 literal sprite objects that move according to web audio frequency data. Our mission:
 - using the debugger, check out the object literals in `spriteArray` to see what they look like
 - make a copy of `ES-5-sprite-literals.html` and name it `ES6-circle-class.html`:
   - Now re-write the `createSprites()` function, get rid of the object literals, and instead use an ES6 class named `CircleSprite`
   - using the debugger, check out the `CircleSprite`s in `spriteArray` to see what they look like
 - make a copy of `ES6-circle-class.html` and name it `ES6-inheritance.html`:
   - create a class that `CircleSprite` will inherit from named `DisplayObject`, and give it `x`, `y`, `height`, `width`, `fwd`, and `speed` properties, `move()`, `reflectX()`, `reflectY()`, and an empty `draw()` method
   - using the debugger, check out the `CircleSprite`s in `spriteArray` to see what they look like - can you see the "prototype chain" in action?
 - (time allowing, and there probably isn't any left) make a copy of `ES6-inheritance.html` and name it `ES6-square-class.html`:
   - create a class named `SquareSprite` that inherits from  `DisplayObject`
   - have it draw itself as a rectangle, and rotate around its center axis every frame
   - in the debugger, check out the lengthening "prototype chain"
