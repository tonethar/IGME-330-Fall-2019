# Week 5B - JavaScript ES6 Module Pattern

## I. Overview & Presentation

- Are you sick of writing all of your JS code in one file and jamming everything into the global scope? ***You should be!***
- Today we are going to look at two ES5 ways to write more modular code - see below!
  - [Demo - IIFE ("*Immediately Invoked Function Expression*")](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-iife.md)
  - [Demo - ES5 *Revealing Module Pattern*](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-revealing-module-pattern.md)
- Why else should you care? One of the requirements of Project 1 is to utilize the ES5 *Revealing Module Pattern*
- PS - We will be looking at [ES6 modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) in a few weeks!
